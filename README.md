# Billiards

This is a PyQt-based billiards table simulation.  Only the position and velocity of the billiard balls is considered.
A more sophisticated simulation would take orientation and angular velocity into account as well so that you could
get some non-linear motion, and more interesting collisions.  Nevertheless, I'm quite happy with the results of this project.
